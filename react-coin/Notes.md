# Notes

## Tooling and Environment Setup
* Download language babel for ES6 Javascript, this package provides language grammar, JSX syntax, automatic indentation, and much more repository located here: https://atom.io/packages/language-babel
* Install React Dev tools for Chrome so that you can inspect the Components when developing
* run npm install which will then install the dependencies from package.json
* Dev dependencies are only for development not used for production, whereas dependencies is used for production
* react-scripts, allows you to do "create react-app", it sets up babel that compiles our ES6 and JSX into older javascript, configures web pack which is a modular bundler that puts our code and all its dependencies into one javascript file in correct order, which means we don't have to include scripts in html files, we can just import them
