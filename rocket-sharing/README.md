# Rocket Sharing Web App
Initial idea is to create a ride sharing service on rockets payloads, meaning provide a service for hypothetical cube-sats (micro satellites) to easily hitch a ride on rockets depending upon their availability.

## Motivation
The motivation is to develop my skills as a full-stack developer as well as explore my interests in the realm of aerospace. With more and more space launch companies starting up, I thought maybe one day this service might be of use.
